Chapter 3 explained about what companies were looking at the interview for recruiting experienced candidates, Testers, Product Manager, and etc. The most interesting part was acquisitions section. I hear over Google, Facebook, and Apple buys startups, but never imagined what is going on behind such scenes. 

On the page of 23rd, there was sample questions:

	Find all possible integer solutions under 1,000 to a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3

I cannot solve at first. Here is my solution after I looked up explanations on the page 68. I did it by Javascript, and it is not simple nor neat code. But it does what the question asks. I want to come back and work on this to seek more elegant way.

Chapter 4 was about how to prepare to the interview. The book says to plan an year ahead to get a job. I need to do catching up as much as I can!!
