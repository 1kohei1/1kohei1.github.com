When I got at the office this morning, there was a book on my desk. It was [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850). I wondered who put the book and what the book was about. I read the short bio of author on the back, and I got excited about the book's contents. The author, Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple; not as sales or marketing, but as a software engineer. 

The fact that turned me on was "worked at Google." When someone asks me what I'm going to do after university, I always answer "Not sure yet after graduation. But I want to do internship at Google on summer, 2016." My longing to Google starts from the day I watched [The Internship](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234155/) on the plane to United States. Smart people, innovative products, and playful workplace gripped me. 

From the day I decided to do internship at Google, I began to read internet posts about how they recruite and make hiring decisions. I also read [How Google Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344). However, none of them did not give me enough information how to prepare myself at the interview. I wanted to do internship at Google, but it seemed unattainable goal.

Then, this book comes. The good point about this book is it covers both questions at the interviews and basic computer science knowledge. I learned programming by myself, so some of basic concepts of algorhythm and computer science is missing. So this books should help me out to learn base of computer science. [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850) is made by two parts. First parts explains company thoughts behind interviews scenes and strategy to attack hard interview questions, and the second part give you basic computer science knowledge to prepare you at the interview.

I'm very excited about this book. This book should give me the first step towards internship at Google on the summer, 2016. Thank you Boss!
